question1->the console is used for web page interactive by using javascript.
their are different types of console objects they are as follows:

1)console.log():-This is basically used for print .we used it print different types of datatypes also.
2)console.error():-This is used for testing .it print default error messsage.
3)console.warn():-This is for warning message.
4)console.clear():-As name itself shows that it is used for clear the console.
5)console.time()or timeend() :-which shows the time required to run a block of code.
6)console.table():- it is for createing table in console .we can give input through the arrays.
7)console.count():-this is used for number of times function gets called.
8)console.group():-it is used for group a content.

question2->
var:-var is declared in the function  then it is only for the function or else we dacleare it outside the function
     then it becames global .the disadvantages of the var is as we may get change the value  in big codeand it will
     give wrong output.

let:-let for scope it is definite in the block.which gives the advantages.

const:-we unable to change the varible of const if we change it shows us error .

question3:-javascript has dynamic types.This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types
           
1)string: e.g var name="hello" which is used between single and double quotes.
2)number:- number is used for a declartion of numbetr they may be int or float e.g var=2or 2.2.
3)booleans:-which check the condition and gives out but as false or true.
4)array:-Array items are separated by commas. e.g var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
